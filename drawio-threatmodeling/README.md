# Draw.io libraries for threat modeling

This is a collection of custom libraries to turn the free and cross-platform [Draw.io] diagramming application into the perfect tool for threat modeling.

## Data Flow Diagrams

[Data Flow Diagramming] is a simple diagramming technique used to gain an understanding of how data flows in an application or system. DFDs are excellent for getting a bird's-eye view of a system to facilitate threat modeling.

[Attack Trees] are another kind of diagramming method that is great for exploring how a threat actor might attain a specific goal, or how an asset might be attacked.
